# Pcl.NET
PCL (PointCloudLibrary) C# wrapper.

## Description

Pcl.NET is a simpe C# wrapper over the huge PointCloudLibrary. It is designed to be simple to use but to keep it as similar as possibile to the usage of the 
original C++ PCL. It was inspired by the existing [PclSharp](https://github.com/jbruening/PclSharp) but insted of using code generators everything is 
coded. This choice was made in order to have a higher degree of flexibility and to make it possible to modify and improve it in a simpler way, even 
if more code has to be written. Right now a lot of stuff is missing but it is already in an usable state.
